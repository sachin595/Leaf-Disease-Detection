## Abstract

This project focuses on the detection and classification of plant leaf diseases using image processing techniques and artificial intelligence. By leveraging methods such as k-means clustering, feature extraction, and support vector machine classifiers, the system identifies diseases like Alternaria Alternata, Anthracnose, Bacterial Blight, and Cercospora Leaf Spot. It utilizes MATLAB for processing, segmentation, and classification to enhance detection accuracy while minimizing computational effort. The approach aims to reduce agricultural losses, optimize pesticide use, and provide an economically efficient solution for farmers.
